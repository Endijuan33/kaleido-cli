## Kaleido Mining Bot
•Kaleido Mining Bot is an automated script for mining KLDO tokens from Kaleido Finance Testnet. It enables multi-wallet mining while following Kaleido's latest security measures to avoid bans and rate limits.

## ⚠️Important Security Guidelines

**To ensure smooth operation and avoid account restrictions, follow these rules when running the bot:**

-**_Account & Device Limits: Max 2 accounts per device, max 5 accounts per IP subnet (Hotspots included). Exceeding these limits may result in temporary or permanent bans._**

-**_VPN/Proxy Restrictions: VPNs and proxies are detected and may lead to account suspension. Always use a real, unmodified network connection._**

-**_Anti-Bot Protection: The bot follows human-like interaction patterns to avoid detection. Avoid making excessive mining requests in a short period._**

-**_Rate Limiting: Mining requests are limited to 5 attempts per hour per account. Exceeding this limit may result in temporary cooldowns or account bans._**
